# Introduction
This is a GitHub repo for my course COMP-8347, which contains all the labs, projects, and lectures. Below is the information related to the project, which is in the Project\comp8347 folder.

# Django Course Website

This is a course website built with Django where users can learn different skills by taking paid courses. The website features a payment system, allowing users to purchase courses and view them at their convenience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    https://github.com/hamzaBaig1998/COMP-8347-Internet-Application-and-Distributed-System
   <br> `cd Project\comp8347`
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
<br>`python -m venv venv`
<br>`source venv/bin/activate` # for Linux/macOS
<br>`venv\Scripts\activate`# for Windows
4. Install the dependencies:
  <br> `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Set up the database:
   <br>`python manage.py migrate`
6. Start the development server:
   <br>`python manage.py runserver`
   
The website should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Features
